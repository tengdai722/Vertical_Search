Autumn Panzanella Salad
Heat oven to 400°. Toss ciabatta with 1⁄4 cup olive oil, plus salt, and pepper on a baking sheet; spread into an even layer. Bake, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, 12–15 minutes; transfer to a large bowl and let cool. Heat pancetta in a 12" skillet over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 20–22 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to bowl with bread; set aside. Add shallots to pan; cook until soft, about 4 minutes; transfer to bowl with bread. Whisk vinegar, lemon juice, thyme, rosemary, honey, salt, and pepper in another bowl. While whisking, slowly drizzle in oil until dressing is emulsified. Add arugula, pine nuts, cranberries, salt, and pepper to bowl with bread. Drizzle dressing over the top; toss to combine.
