Fast-track Fiji: making the most of a stopover
With more than 330 islands, a rich, ancient culture and showstopping scenery both on land and below its incredibly blue waters, you could easily spend an eternity exploring fabulous Fiji. But if forever isn’t feasible, don’t despair: even if you’re en route to elsewhere, a layover in the ‘Land of Smiles’ is a holiday unto itself. Whether you’re here for two days or a few hours, there’s an abundance of attractions, activities and experiences all within easy reach of Nadi International Airport. Back home, two days might pass in a bleary blink of an eye, but you’re on Fiji time now. Nadi is the gateway to some of the country’s most accessible – and alluring – parcels of paradise; whether it’s an island escape or a city break that brings you bliss, a 48-hour mini-holiday here is sure to leave you with memories that will last a lifetime. A 20-minute ride from the airport is Denarau Marina, which acts as the springboard to the spectacular Mamanuca and Yasawa islands. Arguably Fiji’s most divine drawcards, these 50-odd islands attract tons of romantics, resort-hoppers and roving families for their sugar-soft sands, eye-poppingly blue waters and enchanting escapism.
