Where to go in Iceland this winter
Winter in Iceland brings a special kind of adventure, from chasing the shape-shifting Northern Lights to trekking through caves of glacial blue ice. Despite its chilly name, the Land of Fire and Ice isn’t inhospitable to winter wanderers. The ‘Golden Circle’ region of the south-west hovers just below freezing. While it's no-go in the central highlands, the Ring Road, which trails the coast, stays open all year. Bear in mind, though, that you’ll need studded tyres to drive the Ring Road, plus a willingness to quickly change your plans in harsh weather. Of course, you can avoid the dodgy driving conditions by sticking to the cities or booking onto a tour. However you decide to do it, here are our top five places to go in Iceland in winter. With an average January daytime temperature of 0.5°C (similar to winter temps in New York) there's nothing stopping you from packing your parka and heading to the world’s most northernly capital. In town, multicoloured rooftops are dwarfed by the monster spire of the concrete-clad Hallgrimskirkja church. One of several avant-garde buildings that make Reykjavík a treat for those with a thirst for design. Food is better than you'd think; the New Nordic scene throws up twists on traditional dishes such as reindeer and puffin. Restaurant Dill was awarded Iceland’s first Michelin star last year. Old fishing factories at the Grandi Harbour are now hipster cafes, restaurants and breweries. Enrol in “beer school” at the Bryggjan Brewery to learn about their methods while you taste the craft beers. When (if?) you need a break from the booze, go in search of orca, humpback, and minke whales on a boat trip from the Old Harbour, which run year-round. A springboard for the Golden Circle, you can day-trip from Reykjavík to the site of the old (outdoor) parliament, or the incredible Geysir waterspout.
