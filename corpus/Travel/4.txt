Best detours from Mumbai
Overflowing with indigenous flora and fauna, 2000-year-old Buddhist caves and two of largest lakes supplying water to Mumbai, Sanjay Gandhi National Park is one of the most important ecological hotspots in India, tucked into the northern outskirts of the city. Often called the ‘lungs of Mumbai’, this green space offers plenty for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. Beyond the zoo-like attractions by the park entrance are nature walks, cycling tours, and rambles through caves that once hosted a thriving Buddhist monastic community. Deeper inside the park, you can admire the beautiful Mumbai skyline from the highest point in the city, Jambulmal, rising 468m above the city. A trip to SGNP promises calm, fresh air and a happy high that will leave you wondering if you are indeed in the chaotic city of Mumbai.
