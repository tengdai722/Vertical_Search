Located in the southwest of the island it's one of the best known surf spots in the country, but still keeps its charm. With a palm-fringed shore lined with drink shacks and restaurants, you'll find little reason to tear yourself away from the sand. As for the waves themselves, they're consistent, peeling slowly towards the shore, and particularly ideal for beginners. The best time to surf here is October to April, when the weather is a cosy 30. If you want a break from the waves to rest those paddling arms of fury or if the weather has taken a turn, head for some snorkelling in Hikkaduwa National Park. This coral sanctuary is home to plenty of marine life, from turtles to tropical fish. Inland, there are Buddhist temples such as Gangarama Maha Vihara, decorated with hand-painted murals, and Thotagamuwa Rajamaha Viharaya, 2km north of the town.
