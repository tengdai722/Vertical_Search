The best hotels in Spain: pick of the paradores
Hostal dos Reis Católicos, Santiago de Compostela. Apparently the oldest hotel in the world, the Hostal dos Reis Católicos is impressively set in a fifteenth-century hospital at the end of the Camino de Santiago in A Coruña province. Its 136 irresistibly luxurious rooms are arranged around four separate tranquil courtyards, and there are also two restaurants and a plush bar. It’s worth every penny, especially if you get a pilgrims’ or multi-day discount. Parador Carlos V, Jarandilla. This majestic former imperial palace is set in the verdant Vera valley in Extremadura. Castillo de la Suda has a splendid palm-fringed courtyard, period furnishings and a very good restaurant serving Extremeño cuisine. What's more, there's an open-air pool in summer. Parador Condes de Alba y Aliste, Zamora. Occupying a grand fifteenth-century palace in the middle of a quiet town, Zamora’s Parador is gentility defined. It mixes lovely rooms with princely trappings throughout, from the heroic medallions surmounting the internal courtyard to the idly positioned suits of armour. An elevated garden terrace and open-air summer pool have city views, while a fine restaurant serves updated cuisine from the Duero region.
